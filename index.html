<h1>Ayatallah Elakhras</h1>
<p>I am a PhD student at EPFL, working in the Processor Architecture Laboratory under the supervision of Paolo Ienne. Between October 2023 and March 2024, I did an internship at AMD in the Research and Advanced development team, under the supervision of Kristof Denolf. I received a BSc degree in Computer Engineering from the American University in Cairo, Egypt, in 2020 and started my PhD in the same year. 

  My research interests include electronic design automation, computer architecture and compilers. My current research focuses on optimizing dataflow circuits generated for dynamically scheduled high-level synthesis.</p>
