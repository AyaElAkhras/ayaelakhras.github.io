<h1>Ayatallah Elakhras</h1>
<p>I am a Ph.D. student at <a href="https://www.epfl.ch/en/">École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne</a> (EPFL), Switzerland, working in the <a href="https://www.epfl.ch/labs/lap/">Processor Architecture Laboratory</a> under the supervision of <a href="https://people.epfl.ch/paolo.ienne">Paolo Ienne</a>. 
  Between October 2023 and March 2024, I did an internship at <a href="https://www.amd.com/en/technologies/pro-technologies?gad_source=1&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIuJydldGBhAMVKdPCBB3DOA8jEAAYASAAEgLIqvD_BwE">AMD</a> in the Research and Advanced Development team, under the supervision of <a href="https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=fBJzQcQAAAAJ&hl=en">Kristof Denolf</a>. 
  I received a B.Sc. degree in Computer Engineering from the <a href="https://www.aucegypt.edu/">American University in Cairo</a> (AUC), Egypt, in 2020 and started my Ph.D. in the same year.</p>

<p> My research interests include electronic design automation, computer architecture and compilers. My current research focuses on optimizing dataflow circuits generated for dynamically scheduled high-level synthesis.</p>
